          <p>
          Hey all, My name is Usman, I was born and raised in Kansas City, where I developed a passion for technology and security. This interest led me to pursue a major in Cybersecurity at Rockhurst University. My goal is to graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity and build a career protecting digital systems and information. I am gaining knowledge in network security, data protection, and ethical hacking, and I am excited to apply these skills in the field.
